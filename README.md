Key Features:
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked, based on genres, actors, directors, or plot keywords.

Search & Browse: Users can explore movies by category, release year, rating, or popularity.

User Profiles: Each user has a dynamic profile that evolves as more movies are rated or watched.
